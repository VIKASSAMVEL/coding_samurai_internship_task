 
# Coding Samurai Internship Submission

## Overview
This repository contains the completed tasks for the Coding Samurai Machine Learning Internship. The projects demonstrate practical skills in data science, machine learning, and deep learning, following the guidelines and requirements provided by Coding Samurai.

## Projects

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction
- Predicts customer churn using the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset.
- Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression), evaluation, and visualizations.
- Results: ~81.7% test accuracy. Key features identified for churn prediction.
- Files:
  - `Customer_Churn_Prediction/churn_prediction.py`: Main script
  - `Customer_Churn_Prediction/REPORT.md`: Project report
  - Saved images: `confusion_matrix.png`, `churn_distribution.png`, `feature_importance.png`

### 2. Handwritten Digit Recognition
- Recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and a neural network (Keras).
- Covers data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualizations.
- Results: ~98.1% test accuracy. High precision and recall for all digit classes.
- Files:
  - `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition/digit_recognition.py`: Main script
  - `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition/REPORT.md`: Project report
  - Saved images: `mnist_samples.png`, `confusion_matrix.png`, `training_history.png`

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed (with required packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow).
2. Navigate to each project folder and run the main script to reproduce results and generate visualizations.
