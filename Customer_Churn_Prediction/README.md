# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on behavioral and demographic data. Churn prediction helps businesses retain customers and improve their services.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer data
- Engineer relevant features
- Build and evaluate classification models
- Tune model performance

## Skills Practiced
- Feature engineering
- Classification algorithms
- Model evaluation and tuning

## Dataset
Use a customer dataset containing features such as age, tenure, usage, and demographics. Example datasets can be found on Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Steps
1. Data preprocessing and exploration
2. Feature engineering
3. Model building (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
4. Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Final report and demonstration video
